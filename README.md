🧠 Tic Tac Toe AI — Play Against Reinforcement Learning, Minimax & Random Bots

This project is an AI-powered Tic Tac Toe game where you can play against three different types of agents:

    🤖 Reinforcement Learning Agent — Trained using Temporal Difference (TD) learning and state-value estimation.
    🧠 Minimax Agent — Implements the classic game-theory-based Minimax algorithm.
    🎲 Random Agent — Chooses valid moves at random (baseline).

You can also use Streamlit in the code, this app provides an interactive web interface to play, compare, and analyze how these algorithms behave and perform.
